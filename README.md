1. Encryption and System Destruction
Phantasm M starts by encrypting critical files, making recovery almost impossible. Here's how it works:

System32 Files: It encrypts essential files that Windows needs to run, making your system unbootable.
Hard Drive Files: It also targets other files on your drives, locking them away and preventing access, even affecting backups.
User Folders: Personal folders like Documents, Pictures, and Videos are encrypted, making it impossible to retrieve your personal data.
The encryption is tough to crack, using a proprietary method that requires advanced tools—or luck—to recover anything.

2. User Profile Corruption
Phantasm M also goes after your user profile:

Deleting or Corrupting Profiles: It messes up your profile settings so that when you try to log in, it simply won’t load.
Loss of Personal Data: Things like desktop items, saved preferences, and recent documents get wiped out or corrupted, leaving you with a profile that's hard to restore.
This makes recovering your settings and personal files a major headache, often forcing you to reinstall the operating system.

3. Disturbing Audio Effects
On top of everything else, Phantasm M plays creepy sounds to make the experience even worse:

Weird, Distorted Sounds: As it runs, your computer starts producing strange, unsettling noises that make it almost impossible to focus or get work done.
Random Interruptions: Sometimes the sounds cut out, or you get bursts of white noise or high-pitched frequencies—basically making your computer unbearable to use.
It’s more than just a nuisance—it’s designed to unsettle and frustrate you, adding to the chaos.

4. Registry Corruption (Regedit)
The Windows Registry is a core part of your system, and Phantasm M deliberately breaks it:

Modifying Important Keys: It tweaks or deletes key entries in the registry that control startup processes, drivers, and system settings, causing the system to crash or behave erratically.
No Easy Fix: These changes can’t easily be undone, even through System Restore. Phantasm M removes restore points or corrupts them.
This means that trying to recover your system becomes a real challenge, often requiring a complete reinstall.

5. Damaging DLL Files
Phantasm M doesn’t just damage your registry—it also goes after your DLL files (Dynamic Link Libraries), which are crucial for running programs:

Corrupting System DLLs: These are shared by multiple programs, and Phantasm M overwrites them, causing software and system processes to crash or fail.
App Compatibility Issues: Programs depending on these DLLs won’t work, leading to constant errors, slowdowns, and crashes.
By targeting these files, it effectively breaks the entire software ecosystem on your device.

6. Overwriting the MBR (Master Boot Record)
One of the most severe aspects of Phantasm M is that it overwrites the MBR (Master Boot Record):

Fractal Overwrite: It replaces the MBR with a 512-byte fractal written in Assembly. This fractal is designed to be compact and effective, stopping your system from booting up properly.
Minimal Code: The code is simple but powerful. It’s designed to be undetectable by most security software and causes the system to fail to boot entirely.
When you reboot, the system won’t load the OS anymore, leaving you with a bricked device.

7. Corrupting the BCD (Boot Configuration Data)
The BCD (Boot Configuration Data) is key to how your computer boots. Phantasm M corrupts this too:

Damaging BCD Files: It alters the files that control the boot process, making the system unbootable. Even if you manage to recover the MBR, the BCD is so messed up that the system can’t boot up.
This adds another layer of complexity, making it much harder to fix your system and return it to a functional state.

8. Surreal Visual Effects
Phantasm M also disrupts the graphics of your system, using GDI (Graphics Device Interface) through C# code to create strange effects:

Rotating Circles: It displays rotating circles on the screen, distorting and shifting in a way that feels unnatural and unsettling.
Bitmap Manipulation: It uses StretchBlt and other effects to stretch and distort images, creating visual chaos.
Psychedelic Colors: The program shifts colors using intense HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) values and LSD-like color effects that can make your screen look unnervingly psychedelic.
These visual effects make your computer difficult to use, and it feels like a bad trip with continuous distortion.

9. Easter Egg: BSOD and New MBR with 2050 Date
Phantasm M has a hidden “Easter Egg” that adds even more danger:

BSOD (Blue Screen of Death): If you run the malware with the system date set to 2050, it will trigger a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death), crashing the system completely.
New MBR Overwrite: After the BSOD, Phantasm M overwrites the MBR again, causing a reset and making it even harder to recover your system.
This hidden trap adds an extra layer of complexity and danger to the malware.

10. Designed for nFire: Italian Cybersecurity YouTube Channel
Phantasm M wasn’t just made for destruction—it was created as a challenge for nFire, an Italian YouTube channel focused on cybersecurity. The malware tests the resilience of security systems and challenges experts in the field to protect their systems from such a sophisticated attack.

11. Technical Implementation of MBR and GDI
MBR in Assembly: The MBR is overwritten with a minimal but effective Assembly code, making it very difficult to detect or stop. The code is specifically designed to break the system’s boot process in a way that’s difficult to fix.

GDI in C#: The graphic distortions, including rotating shapes, color manipulations, and Bitmap stretching, are all done using C# and GDI. This gives Phantasm M the ability to create surreal and disorienting visuals while also causing system instability.
